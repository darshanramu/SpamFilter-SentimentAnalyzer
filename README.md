Part 1:
-------
SPAM:
Precision = 0.9649 
Recall = 0.9835
F-Score = 0.9741 

SENTIMENT:
Precision = 0.8952 
Recall = 0.9077 
F-Score = 0.89.59

Part 2:
-------
SPAM:
Precision = 0.9809 
Recall = 0.9917 
F-Score = 0.9862 

SENTIMENT:
Precision = 0.9012 
Recall = 0.9085 
F-Score = 0.9045 

Q3:
Precision, Recall and F-Score will decrease as the content of training set is 
reduced to 10% and we will have less data to learn from and can't classify 
the new words we see in the test properly.
